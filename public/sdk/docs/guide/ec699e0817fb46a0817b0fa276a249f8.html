			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is a client UI technology based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. </p>

			<p class="p">Apps developed with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> run in a browser on any device (mobile, tablet or desktop
				PC). </p>

			<p class="p">When users access an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> app, a request is sent to the respective server to load
				the application into the browser. The view accesses the relevant libraries. Usually the model is also instantiated and business data is fetched
				from the database.</p>

			<p class="p">Depending on the environment in which <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is used, the libraries or your
				applications can be stored, for example, on an <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver Application Server</span> or an <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA Cloud Platform</span>, and business data can be accessed, for example, using the OData model
				through a <span class="ph pname">SAP Gateway</span>.</p>
